// DAG: flow demo

// download by file

}

// mapping by group, a group include one or may file(s)
mapping {
  scope = group
  dependencies = download  // the files of group download finished then start mapping task
}

// analysis by project
analysis {
  scope = project
  dependencies = mapping  // the mapping tasks of group finished then start the analysis task of project
}
